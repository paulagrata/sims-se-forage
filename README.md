***Dividing Household Member UI by Sims and Pets***

**Overview:**

Currently, players are limited to only 8 household member slots shared with both Sims and Pets. An implementation with a toggle button that switches between views, a player can view their household members separately by Sims and Pets [cats, dogs, horses]. This will allow for the player to have 8 full slots for Sims and 8 full slots for pets.

**Value Statement:**

With the addition of cats, dogs, and horses - the household members have become overcome with animals not allowing the player to get a complete family experience allowing more than a few sims per household while sharing the member capacity with the animals. By separating the UI of the household members, this could allow more Sims to be added to the family without interfering with the animals on the lot.

**Solution:**Â 

Adding a button to the existing UI that will toggle between household sim members and household pets/animals. This button will behave the same way as switching between the needs, skills, relationship, etc. tabs except it will be on the left side where the household characters are and will then switch between displaying the householder sim members and the household animals. 

**Evaluation statement:**

**Pros:** Can add more than the original 8 household members, since this will allow users to add up to 8 total sims and 8 total animals since the UI will be able to hold that many between the button that will toggle between sims and animals. 

**Cons:** Some systems may have slower gameplay with a full 8 total sims and 8 total animals. Users may not to see all household member's need color since they will need to toggle between the two.
